Some fares can be overridden like so, but we dont show the override: http://www.brfares.com/#expert?orig=BYB&dest=FSK
    This means many of the fare prices quoted are incorrect
    We can maybe get this data from the NFO file.

Convex hull on voronoi - I have tried this many times. It might be easier with different voronoi lib
Add OSIs as Â£0 fares. Also there are some OSIs outside of london

Dijkstra to read in lines.json and optimise for price and then number of changes.

Add more tags and show them on page:
    HDW: Great Northern, Zone 6, TFL, National Rail, DFT Category E
    KWG: London Overground, District Line, Zone 3, Zone 4, TFL, National Rail


Notes on stations removed:
    Deduplicated where there existed stations with oyster not accepted.
    Should result in no gaps for inner London queries.
    Will need to deduplicate and merge fares for benefit of outer London queries,
    e.g. HAT -> stratford. Need to merge as not identical:
    select * from fare where to_id='940GZZLUHWC' and from_id in ("910GVAUXHLM","940GZZLUVXL");


People have expressed interest in return fares
    Will double the amount of json - maybe it should be segregated
    Some returns require return travel on same or next day. Will need to assume the most restrictive
    Need to incorporate singles data.

I would like to see what the season ticket map looks like.
