Convex hull on voronoi?
Add off peak NR fares

Default fare view only shows oyster for selecting a tube station. Try to add fares like 'London Z1-6 to Hatfield'.

Check for bug: select one from station, then another whilst it is loading. May show incorrect fares in map.

Bug: Split ticket code reuses previous results and will return nested split tickets. e.g A->G when D has been queried previously = [A,B,C,[D,E,F,G]]

Notes:
Deduplicated where there existed stations with oyster not accepted.
Should result in no gaps for inner London queries.
Will need to deduplicate and merge fares for benefit of outer London queries,
e.g. HAT -> stratford. Need to merge as not identical:
select * from fare where to_id='940GZZLUHWC' and from_id in ("910GVAUXHLM","940GZZLUVXL");

Mysteries:
Tring->Harrow on the Hill. BRFares/shops return many incl 1393 -> 0786 ZONE U1256 LONDN. HOH not in 0786, in ATOC.

HAT->Elephant and castle. None! http://www.brfares.com/#expert?orig=HAT&dest=EPH

Add OSIs as Â£0 fares.

Dijkstra to read in lines.json and optimise for price and then number of changes.

HDW: Great Northern, Zone 6, TFL, National Rail, DFT Category E
