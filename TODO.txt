Why FST -> LBG = Â£1.00? Not on BRFares
Deduplicate NR fares A->B. e.g. HAT -> EPH. Take min?
Add off peak NR fares

Notes:
Deduplicated where there existed stations with oyster not accepted. Should result in no gaps for inner London queries. Will need to deduplicate and merge fares for benefit of outer London queries, e.g. HAT -> stratford. Need to merge as not identical: select * from fare where to_id='940GZZLUHWC' and from_id in ("910GVAUXHLM","940GZZLUVXL");
