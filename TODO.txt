Must do:
Remove mapbox

add some of these https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/events
Bug: Split ticket SAC -> OXS peak shows twice.
timetable split ticket disclaimer

Nice to have:

Convex hull on voronoi - I have tried this many times. It might be easier with different voronoi lib
Z1-6 fares for travelling to tube stn from outside london
Add OSIs as Â£0 fares. Also there are some OSIs outside of london

Dijkstra to read in lines.json and optimise for price and then number of changes.

Add more tags and show them on page:
    HDW: Great Northern, Zone 6, TFL, National Rail, DFT Category E
    KWG: London Overground, District Line, Zone 3, Zone 4, TFL, National Rail


Notes on stations removed:
    Deduplicated where there existed stations with oyster not accepted.
    Should result in no gaps for inner London queries.
    Will need to deduplicate and merge fares for benefit of outer London queries,
    e.g. HAT -> stratford. Need to merge as not identical:
    select * from fare where to_id='940GZZLUHWC' and from_id in ("910GVAUXHLM","940GZZLUVXL");


NR -> TFL underground:
    Z1-6 fares for travelling to tube stn from outside london are not included
    There is no direct way to map a group like 0825 ZONE U234* LONDN to a station like 0647 MORDEN UND
    The only way (used by Brfares/librailfare in locations.c:514) is to parse the description of the group
        and the zone indicator of the und station
    Will also require setting the CRS for every TFL station
    However even then, the fare I checked for HAT -> ZMO was unpublishable and I ran out of memory trying to include those.

Mysteries:
    Tring->Harrow on the Hill. BRFares/shops return many incl 1393 -> 0786 ZONE U1256 LONDN. HOH not in 0786, in ATOC.
    HAT->Elephant and castle. None! http://www.brfares.com/#expert?orig=HAT&dest=EPH
