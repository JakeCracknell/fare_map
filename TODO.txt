Deduplicate NR fares A->B. e.g. HAT -> EPH. Take min?
Add off peak NR fares

Split ticketing using A*:
    Change API to return FareDetails, not stations. Retrun Djikstra response not 1 to 1.
    Show route as lines on map.
    Color lines based on cumulative cost?
    Show breakdown of route in table
    Checkbox to show/hide split ticket lines and route in table

Djikstra speedups: deduplicate faredetails, cache cheapest fare prices.

Notes:
Deduplicated where there existed stations with oyster not accepted.
Should result in no gaps for inner London queries.
Will need to deduplicate and merge fares for benefit of outer London queries,
e.g. HAT -> stratford. Need to merge as not identical:
select * from fare where to_id='940GZZLUHWC' and from_id in ("910GVAUXHLM","940GZZLUVXL");

Mysteries:
Tring->Harrow on the Hill. BRFares/shops return many incl 1393 -> 0786 ZONE U1256 LONDN. HOH not in 0786, in ATOC.
